# StatisticalTest_Welch
The Welch's t-test is applied to determine the significance between the results obtained in two different conditions. For each condition there is 3 replicas, so the code obtains the data results from the different simulations, calculates the average value and the standard deviation, and then compare this final value with the other condition. If the p-value is lower than 0.05, then the difference between boh conditions is significant.

For the water mediated interactions the t-test is applied for the number of water bridges for each condition, and also for the frequency value of each specific interactive residues forming a water bridge .
